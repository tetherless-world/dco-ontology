In contrast to previous versions developed through SSN and in conjunction with ISO 19150-2, this ontology has minimal dependencies on existing ontologies, particularly those that trigger extended chains of imports. Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. 
The model for Specimen has a dependency on W3C PROV-O. Specimen is modelled as a subclass of prov:Entity, so PROV can be used to describe specimen preparation chains. """^^xsd:string ;

In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.

NOTE A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.

A sampling feature is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain, so there is an expectation of at least one sampledFeature property.

When observations are made to estimate properties of a geospatial feature, in particular where the value of a property varies within the scope of the feature, a spatial sampling feature is used. Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.

This classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value."""^^xsd:string ;
